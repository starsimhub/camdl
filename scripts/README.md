# `scripts/` — review zip generator

The single script in this directory is `review-zip.sh`. It produces
source-tree snapshots scoped to a subsystem, for handing to an
external code reviewer (another LLM agent, a collaborator, whoever).
Everything else about review packaging has been deliberately
consolidated here.

Paste-ready reviewer prompt + staging order lives in
[`review-request.md`](review-request.md) — copy from there when
handing a zip to an agent.

## Usage

```
./scripts/review-zip.sh inference    # one subsystem
./scripts/review-zip.sh all          # every subsystem
./scripts/review-zip.sh full         # whole repo
./scripts/review-zip.sh list         # subsystems + token estimates
./scripts/review-zip.sh clean        # rm review-zips/*.zip
```

Output lands in `review-zips/` (overridable via `REVIEW_OUTDIR=…`).
Each subsystem produces `review-<subsystem>-<YYYYMMDD>.zip` with
`camdl/` as the top-level prefix so the reviewer unzips into a
recognisable layout.

## Design

### Why subsystem zips instead of one whole-repo blob

A reviewer with the whole repo sees everything, which sounds good but
is counterproductive: the LLM's context window gets eaten by code the
reviewer doesn't need to audit, leaving less room for the actual
reasoning about the code that matters. Subsystem slicing trades
completeness for focus. The reviewer gets enough code to trace data
flow end-to-end *within the subsystem* but not so much that they lose
their place.

Whole-repo snapshots are still available (`full` subcommand) for cases
where the scope is genuinely repo-wide: new-contributor onboarding, a
cross-cutting bug hunt, a bisection across subsystems. That's the
exception, not the default.

### The four subsystems

The taxonomy carves the codebase along how reviews actually happen in
practice, not along directory boundaries:

- **`inference`** — fit algorithms (IF2, PGAS, NUTS, PMMH, particle
  filter) + the fit CLI that drives them (`cli/src/fit/`) + the IR
  types the algorithms consume + shared plumbing (see below). Most
  reviews anchored in fit accuracy / convergence / output shape land
  here. This zip is the most common request.

- **`engine`** — simulation backends (Gillespie, tau-leap, ODE,
  chain-binomial), propensity evaluator, intervention processing,
  obs sampling + shared plumbing. Reviews of simulate, scenarios,
  sweep batches, or any "does the forward simulation compute the
  right thing" question land here.

- **`compiler`** — OCaml DSL frontend (`ocaml/lib/`, `ocaml/bin/`),
  stratification expansion, IR emission, OCaml tests, golden DSL
  fixtures, and the IR type definitions (`rust/crates/ir/src/`)
  that serve as the contract between compiler and runtime.

- **`docs`** — every spec and proposal in `docs/`, the root
  `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the golden DSL fixtures as
  reference material. Reviews of wording, consistency, or proposal
  design.

### Shared plumbing

A handful of CLI files are duplicated into both `inference` and
`engine`: `cas.rs`, `run_meta.rs`, `run_paths.rs`, `hashing.rs`,
`browse.rs`, `batch.rs`, `main.rs`, `serve.rs`, `util.rs`,
`version.rs`, and `cli/tests/`. These form a "plumbing" layer —
cache invariants, directory layout, run.json schema, CLI dispatch —
used by both fit and simulate codepaths.

We considered making this its own `cli` subsystem. Rejected because
cross-cutting refactors of the plumbing (2026-04-19 unified output
tree, for example) always involve changes in fit *or* simulate at
the same time; a reviewer of either needs the plumbing in the same
zip to follow the data flow. The per-zip duplication cost is ~90K
tokens; the context-switch cost of forcing reviewers to open two
zips is worse.

A standalone plumbing-only review (adding a new subcommand, reworking
cache detection) is the only case where this split costs us — and
those can use the `full` zip or just hand the reviewer specific
files directly.

### Why `git archive` rather than filesystem copy

`git archive HEAD` pulls exactly the tracked state at `HEAD`. No
working-tree cruft, no stale scratch files, no half-staged edits.
What the reviewer sees is what git sees. It's also fast (no
filesystem walk), deterministic (same HEAD → same archive bytes),
and respects `.gitattributes` (e.g. `export-ignore`).

Consequence: uncommitted changes don't make it into the zip. If you
want them reviewed, commit them first. This is a feature, not a
limitation — reviewing uncommitted local state is an anti-pattern
because it can't be bisected, reverted, or pointed at with a sha.

### Token estimates

Each subcommand prints a token estimate (`~380K tokens`). The
estimate is crude: byte count / 4. It's good enough to decide
whether a subsystem fits in one context window and in what order
to hand multiple zips to a reviewer. Sub-10% accuracy isn't the
goal; "does this fit" is.

### Deliberate non-features

- **No diff-scoped zips.** Review only the files touched by a
  specific commit range. Rejected because diff review misses
  bugs in surrounding code that the refactor perturbed but didn't
  originate. Always ship the reviewer the surrounding code too.

- **No auto-exclusion of build artifacts.** Not needed —
  `git archive` doesn't ship anything untracked, so build output
  isn't a concern. Eliminating this manual exclude list (which
  prior scripts maintained) is one of the wins of the `git archive`
  approach.

- **No per-reviewer zip variants.** We don't produce different
  scopes for different reviewers. If a reviewer needs something
  other than the four subsystems, they need a `full` zip and
  we trust them to scope it themselves.

## Extending

Adding a subsystem:
1. Define a new `NEW_SUBSYSTEM=( paths… )` array at the top of
   `review-zip.sh`.
2. Add a `make_zip <name> "${NEW_SUBSYSTEM[@]}" ;;` case in the
   dispatch `case` block and in `all`.
3. Update the `list` subcommand's hardcoded subsystem list.
4. Update this README's "four subsystems" section — the count
   and the taxonomy paragraph both need to move.

Adding a file to an existing subsystem: edit the relevant array.
The explicit-list style is deliberate — no wildcards except what
git-archive naturally supports — so that what's in scope is
auditable by reading the script.
