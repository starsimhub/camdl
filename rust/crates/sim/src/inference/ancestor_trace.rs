//! Ancestor tracing: recover coherent per-particle trajectories from a
//! bootstrap particle filter run.
//!
//! After running the filter, the per-step pre-resample particle states
//! give you filtering marginals `p(x_t | y_{1..t})` at each `t` — but
//! joining particles across `t` by index does NOT give sample paths
//! from the smoothing distribution `p(x_{1:T} | y_{1:T})`, because
//! resampling rearranges the swarm at every step.
//!
//! To recover smoothing draws: pick a particle `j` at the final step
//! with probability proportional to its final log-weight, walk its
//! ancestor chain back to the first step, and collect the state at
//! each point. Doing this N times yields N independent samples from
//! the smoothing distribution (all equally weighted).
//!
//! This module is the primitive both `sim::inference::particle_filter`
//! and (future) `sim::inference::pgas` can share. See
//! `docs/dev/proposals/2026-04-19-pf-latent-trajectories.md`.
